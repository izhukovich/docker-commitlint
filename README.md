# docker-commitlint

This is a preconfigured Docker image with [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org).
It has the following settings

  * Extend `@commitlint/config-conventional`
  * Disable the `scope-case` rule to allow any case
  * Custom `imperative-tense` rule to check subjects for imperative mood

## :rocket: Usage

This image can be used in three ways.

  1. As a standalone `commitlint` CLI
  1. As a pre-commit hook
  2. As a GitHub action

### CLI

```bash
$ docker pull extenda/commitlint
$ echo "feat: add feature" | docker run --rm -i extenda/commitlint
$ docker run --rm -i extenda/commitlint --from HEAD~1
```

### Pre-Commit Hook

The image can be used to build a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hook. Extenda provides a [commitlint pre-commit hook](https://github.com/extenda/pre-commit-hooks) that can be configured like this:

```yaml
- repo: git@github.com:extenda/pre-commit-hooks.git
  rev: v0.4
  hooks:
    - id: commitlint
      stages: [commit-msg]
```

### GitHub Action

To support GitHub actions, the docker image offers an alternative entrypoint under `/usr/local/bin/action`.

```
Usage: action [-c <sha>] [-m <message>]
```

Extenda Retail provides a GitHub action out-of-the-box available
 at https://github.com/extenda/actions/commitlint.
